## Description

Somewhere in your parents' house, there's a plastic bin full of broken promises.

You know the one.

The one your 10-year-old self was CERTAIN would be worth thousands by now. The one you protected with tag covers and stern warnings to siblings. The one that was definitely, absolutely, 100% going to pay for college.

It's time.

HOW IT WORKS

Take a photo. Get a price. Receive emotional support in the form of sarcastic commentary.

Our AI doesn't just identify your Beanie Babies — it delivers the news with the gentle honesty of a friend who's been waiting 25 years to say "I told you so."

WHAT YOU'LL DISCOVER

That most of your collection is worth about as much as the Pogs you threw away. (Those are worth more now. Sorry.)

But occasionally — very occasionally — you might find something actually valuable. And we'll help you figure out exactly what makes it special.

FEATURES

• Instant AI identification from photos
• Brutally accurate market valuations
• Condition & variant detection for potentially rare finds
• Track your collection and total "portfolio" value
• Shareable certificates for maximum social media sympathy
• Zero sugarcoating, maximum closure

NO SUBSCRIPTIONS

One price. Unlimited reality checks.

No account. No login. No ads. No false hope. Just the truth about your plastic-pellet-filled retirement plan.

For everyone who ever whispered "mint condition" like it meant something.
